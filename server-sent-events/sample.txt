Developing a web application that uses server-sent events is straightforward. You'll need a bit of code on the server to stream events to the front-end, but the client side code works almost identically to websockets in part of handling incoming events. This is a one-way connection, so you can't send events from a client to a server.

Receiving events from the server
The server-sent event API is contained in the EventSource interface.

Creating an EventSource instance
To open a connection to the server to begin receiving events from it, create a new EventSource object with the URL of a script that generates the events. For example:
